/**
Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array

Problem Statement: Given an array nums of n integers.

Return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. 
The integers in this sequence can appear in any order.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]  
Output:
 4  
Explanation:
 The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], 
which has a length of 4. 
This sequence can be formed regardless of the initial order of the elements in the array.

Example 2:
Input:
 nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]  
Output:
 9  
Explanation:
 The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 
 which has a length of 9.

Optimal Approach(Using Set data structure):

                // Update the longest sequence length
                longest = max(longest, cnt);
