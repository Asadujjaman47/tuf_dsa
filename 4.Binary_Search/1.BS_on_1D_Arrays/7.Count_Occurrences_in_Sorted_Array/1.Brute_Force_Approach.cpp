/*
Count Occurrences in Sorted Array

Problem Statement: You are given a sorted array containing N integers 
and a number X, you have to find the occurrences of X in the given array.

Examples

Example 1:
Input: N = 7,  X = 3 , array[] = {2, 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4}
Output: 4
Explanation: 3 is occurring 4 times in 
the given array so it is our answer.

Example 2:
Input: N = 8,  X = 2 , array[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 5
Explanation: 2 is occurring 5 times in the given array so it is our answer.
