/**
Leaders in an Array
 
Problem Statement: Given an array, print all the elements which are leaders. 
A Leader is an element that is greater than all of the elements on its right side in the array.

Examples

Example 1:
Input:
 arr = [4, 7, 1, 0]  
Output:
 7 1 0  
Explanation:
 The rightmost element (0) is always a leader.  
7 and 1 are greater than the elements to their right, making them leaders as well.

Example 2:
Input:
 arr = [10, 22, 12, 3, 0, 6]  
Output:
 22 12 6  
Explanation:
 6 is a leader because there are no elements after it.  
12 is greater than all the elements to its right (3, 0, 6), 
and 22 is greater than 12, 3, 0, 6, making them leaders as well.
