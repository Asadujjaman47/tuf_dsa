/*
Find Second Smallest and Second Largest Element in an array

Problem Statement: Given an array, find the second smallest 
and second largest element in the array. 
Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.

Examples

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,4,7,7,5]
Output: Second Smallest : 2
	Second Largest : 5
Explanation: The elements are as follows 1,2,3,5,7,7 
and hence second largest of these is 5 and second smallest is 2

Example 2:
Input: [1]
Output: Second Smallest : -1
	Second Largest : -1
Explanation: Since there is only one element in the array, 
it is the largest and smallest element present in the array. 
There is no second largest or second smallest element present.

Brute Force Approach:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to find the second smallest and second largest elements in the array
void getElements(int arr[], int n)
{
    // Edge case when the array has less than 2 elements
    if(n == 0 || n == 1)
        cout << -1 << " " << -1 << endl;  // Print -1 for both second smallest and second largest if the array has less than 2 elements
    
    // Sort the array to easily find the second smallest and second largest elements
    sort(arr, arr + n);

    // Second smallest element is at index 1 after sorting
    int small = arr[1]; 

    // Second largest element is at index n-2 after sorting
    int large = arr[n - 2]; 

    // Output the second smallest and second largest elements
    cout << "Second smallest is " << small << endl;
    cout << "Second largest is " << large << endl;
}

int main()
{
    // Initialize the array with elements
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 5};
    
    // Calculate the size of the array
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    
    // Call the function to find and print the second smallest and second largest elements
    getElements(arr, n);

    return 0;
