Check if a number is prime or not

Problem Statement: Given an integer N, check whether it is prime or not. 
A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself 
and the total number of divisors is 2.

Examples
                Example 1:
                Input:N = 2
               
                Output:True
                
                Explanation: 2 is a prime number because it has two divisors: 1 and 2 (the number itself).
                                        
                Example 2:
                Input:N =10                
                
                Output: False
                
                Explanation: 10 is not prime, it is a composite number because it has 4 divisors: 1, 2, 5 and 10.      

Optimal Approach:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if a given number is prime
bool checkPrime(int n) {
    int cnt = 0;  // Initialize a counter variable to count the number of factors

    // Loop through numbers from 1 to the square root of n
    for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            cnt++;  // If n is divisible by i, increment the counter

            // If n is not a perfect square, count its reciprocal factor
            if (n / i != i) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }
    }

    // If the number of factors is exactly 2 (1 and the number itself), it's prime
    if (cnt == 2) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;  // If not, it's not a prime number
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1483;  // Example number
    bool isPrime = checkPrime(n);  // Function call to check if the number is prime

    if (isPrime) {
        cout << n << " is a prime number." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << n << " is not a prime number." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

// Time Complexity: O(sqrt(N))
// Space Complexity : O(1)
