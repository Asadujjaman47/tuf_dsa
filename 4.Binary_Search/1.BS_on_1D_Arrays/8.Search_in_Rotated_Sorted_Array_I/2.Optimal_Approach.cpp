/*
Search Element in a Rotated Sorted Array

Problem Statement: Given an integer array nums, 
sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) 
and a target value k. 
The array is rotated at some pivot point that is unknown. 
Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

Examples
Input:nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 0
Output :4
Explanation : Here, the target is 0. 
We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. 
Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 3
Output :-1
Explanation :Here, the target is 3. 
Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. 
Thus, we get the output as -1.

Optimal Approach(Using Binary Search):

        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size() - 1;

        // Continue until the search space becomes invalid
        while (low <= high) {

            // Find the middle index
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            // If the target is found at mid, return mid
            if (nums[mid] == target)
                return mid;

            // Check if the left half is sorted
            if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) {

                // If target lies in the sorted left half, search there

                    low = mid + 1;

                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        // If not found, return -1
        return -1;
    }
