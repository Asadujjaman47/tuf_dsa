/*
Union of Two Sorted Arrays

Problem Statement: Given two sorted arrays, arr1, and arr2 of size n and m. 
Find the union of two sorted arrays.

The union of two arrays can be defined as the common 
and distinct elements in the two arrays.

NOTE: Elements in the union should be in ascending order.

Examples

Input:n = 5,m = 5 arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}  arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5}
Output: {1,2,3,4,5}
Explanation: Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : No distinct elements.
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5}

Input:n = 10,m = 7,arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5,11,12}
Output: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}
Explanation: Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1,6,7,8,9,10
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : 11,12
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}
